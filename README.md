# SQF_DeObfuscationTool
Spire's SQF DeObfuscation Tool

New InfiStar v0145 supported

I really don't know why people make SQF code obfuscated ( Entire code in one line ) because it's too easy parse the code just with notepad LOL...

I made this simple tool because as server owner you should know what code you run on the server.

Place your sqf files to folder with .exe file.

So far program is WIP so it can automatically deObfuscate A3AT.sqf and A3AH.sqf...

You can manually enter one custom filename.

If you want parse your AH or server side code then be my guest.

You will also get smaller files and infistar's AH seems loading a bit faster.
